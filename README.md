# OptiSim

**OptiSim** is a Linux-only geometrical optics simulator focused on modeling and analyzing systems involving **thin and thick lenses**. Designed for students, educators, and researchers, OptiSim provides:

- A **C++ library** and a **Python library** with well-defined APIs for integration into custom applications and simulations  
- A **command-line interface (CLI)** for quick, scriptable usage  
- A **graphical user interface (GUI)** for interactive exploration and visualization

Whether you're importing it into your own software, scripting custom lens simulations, or visually constructing optical setups, OptiSim offers a modular and extensible environment to explore the core principles of geometrical optics.
