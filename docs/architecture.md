# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the OptiSim project's architecture, detailing its primary components, their responsibilities, and how they interact. Understanding this structure is key for effective development and contribution.

## 1. High-Level System Design

OptiSim is designed as a multi-language system, leveraging the strengths of C++ for high-performance computation, Python for scripting and accessibility, and Java for specific enterprise or integration needs. The core logic resides in C++, with Python and Java serving as interfaces and application layers.

## 2. Core Components

The OptiSim system is composed of several distinct, yet interconnected, components:

### 2.1. C++ Core Library

This is the foundational layer of OptiSim, responsible for:
* Implementing high-performance computational algorithms.
* Handling core data structures and complex logic.
* Interacting with external, performance-critical C++ libraries (e.g., Eigen for linear algebra, OpenCV for image processing, Boost for extended functionalities).
The C++ core is designed for efficiency and precision, forming the bedrock of OptiSim's capabilities.

### 2.2. Python Interface (via Pybind11)

The Python layer provides a user-friendly and flexible interface to the powerful C++ core.
* **Role:** Enables Python developers to easily integrate OptiSim's functionalities into their applications, scripts, and data analysis workflows without needing to write C++ code.
* **Technology:** `pybind11` is used to create robust and seamless bindings, exposing C++ classes, functions, and data types directly into Python. This ensures efficient data transfer and method calls between the two languages.

### 2.3. Java Interface (via JPype)

The Java layer allows OptiSim's capabilities to be utilized within Java-based applications and ecosystems.
* **Role:** Facilitates integration into existing Java enterprise systems or applications that require OptiSim's specific functionalities.
* **Technology:** `JPype` acts as a bridge, allowing Python code to access Java classes and objects, and vice versa. This enables cross-language communication, where Python might orchestrate calls to Java components that then interact with the C++ core (or directly with other Java libraries).

## 3. Data Flow and Interoperability

Data typically originates from an application layer (Python or Java), is passed to the C++ core for processing, and then results are returned.

* **Python to C++:** Data is passed efficiently through `pybind11` bindings. Complex data structures are often mapped directly or converted to C++ equivalents.
* **Java to Python/C++:** Java can initiate operations by interacting with the Python layer via `JPype`, which then channels requests to the C++ core. Alternatively, depending on the design, direct integration from Java to C++ might be considered for performance-critical paths if `JPype` overhead is a concern (though `JPype` is generally efficient).
* **C++ to Python/Java:** Results from C++ computations are returned through the respective `pybind11` or `JPype` interfaces, converted into appropriate Python or Java data types.

## 4. Build System Overview

The entire project (C++, Python bindings, Java components) is built through a unified, automated shell script. This script orchestrates the build process, which typically involves:
* CMake configuration for the C++ parts.
* Compilation of C++ source code.
* Generation of `pybind11` Python modules.
* Compilation and packaging of Java components.
This streamlined approach ensures consistency and simplifies the setup for developers.

## 5. Key Design Principles

OptiSim's architecture is guided by the following principles:

* **Performance:** Critical computation-heavy tasks are offloaded to optimized C++ components.
* **Modularity:** Components are designed to be relatively independent, allowing for easier development, testing, and maintenance.
* **Language Agnosticism (Interface Layer):** While core logic is in C++, robust interfaces in Python and Java ensure broad applicability and integration flexibility.
* **Extensibility:** The design aims to allow for easy addition of new functionalities or interfaces in the future without major architectural overhauls.

## 6. Future Considerations (Optional)

As OptiSim evolves, potential architectural considerations may include:
* Distributed computing capabilities for large-scale simulations.
* More direct Java-C++ interfaces if `JPype` becomes a bottleneck for specific high-frequency operations.
* Integration with other language ecosystems as needed.
* Expansion of external library dependencies for specialized tasks.
